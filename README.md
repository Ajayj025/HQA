## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/heal-quick-agent.git](https://github.com/your-username/heal-quick-agent.git)
    cd heal-quick-agent
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *(You'll need to create a `requirements.txt` file containing `groq`, `streamlit`, `st-supabase-connection`, etc. based on your project's exact dependencies.)*

### Supabase Setup

1.  **Create a Supabase project:**
    Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and create a new project.
2.  **Set up your database tables:**
    You'll need tables for `users`, `chat_sessions`, and `chat_messages` with appropriate schemas to match the `AuthService` logic.
    * **`users` table**:
        * `id` (UUID, Primary Key)
        * `email` (Text, Unique)
        * `name` (Text)
        * `created_at` (Timestamp with timezone, Default: `now()`)
    * **`chat_sessions` table**:
        * `id` (UUID, Primary Key, Default: `uuid_generate_v4()`)
        * `user_id` (UUID, Foreign Key to `users.id`)
        * `title` (Text)
        * `created_at` (Timestamp with timezone, Default: `now()`)
    * **`chat_messages` table**:
        * `id` (UUID, Primary Key, Default: `uuid_generate_v4()`)
        * `session_id` (UUID, Foreign Key to `chat_sessions.id`)
        * `content` (Text)
        * `role` (Text, e.g., 'user', 'assistant')
        * `created_at` (Timestamp with timezone, Default: `now()`)

3.  **Configure Environment Variables (Streamlit Secrets):**
    In your Streamlit application, you'll need to configure secrets. For local development, create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file in your project root:

    ```toml
    # .streamlit/secrets.toml
    SUPABASE_URL = "YOUR_SUPABASE_URL"
    SUPABASE_KEY = "YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
    GROQ_API_KEY = "YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY"
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_SUPABASE_URL`, `YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and `YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY` with your actual credentials. For deployment, use Streamlit Cloud's secrets management.

### Running the Application

```bash
streamlit run main.py


üí° Usage
Once the application is running, you can:

Sign Up / Sign In: Create a new account or log in with existing credentials.

Create New Sessions: Start fresh chat sessions for different health inquiries.

Chat with the AI Agent: Input your medical data or questions, and receive AI-generated analysis and responses.
